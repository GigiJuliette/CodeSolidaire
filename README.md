# CodeSolidaire

CodeSolidaire is a simple static website created as part of a collaborative project focused on digital solidarity. The site highlights an initiative aimed at using web development skills to support social and humanitarian causes.

The project was built with contributions from Matthieu, Melody, Th√©o, Alexis, and Juliette.

We used a mix of Bootstrap for layout components and traditional CSS for custom styling.

The website is static and consists mainly of HTML and CSS files.
